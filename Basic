1. Introduction to Java.
Java is a popular, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It is platform-independent, which means code written in Java can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. Basic Structure of a Java Program
A simple Java program consists of a class with a main method. This method is the entry point of any Java application.
how to print hellow world:


public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Prints Hello, World! to the console
    }
}


Key words: key words is presurve word which is already developed by the developer  how to perform.
rules: can not be used key words as method names,class names or variable.
eg: public ,void , Data types, control statements, break,throws,throw,extends,impliments,new etc
 variable: variable is like container to store the data according to the data types.

3. Variables and Data Types
Java has several data types, including int, double, char, and String.


public class DataTypes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25; // Integer
        double salary = 55000.50; // Floating-point number
        char grade = 'A'; // Single character
        String name = "John"; // String (sequence of characters)

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Salary: $" + salary);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
    }
}
